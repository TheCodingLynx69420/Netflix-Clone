# Netflix-UI-Clone
Disclaimer: (i do not own the website this is just a replica for the original one)
Tried my best to clone the Netflix main website page

This is of course not a 100% clone (since netflix website layout might vary from region-to-region) but still those 6 hours i put into this was worth it
special thanks to "Code with harry" a youtuber which helped me a lot to understand the concepts about how to make this. 

This is the part of "SIGMA WEB DEVELOPMENT" course of code with harry (for more info check out his playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVzUXW6siu0&list=PLu0W_9lII9agq5TrH9XLIKQvv0iaF2X3w)
